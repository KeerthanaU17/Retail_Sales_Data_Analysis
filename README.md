      This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Python libraries. 
      The objective is to gain insights from the dataset through a systematic approach that includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
      In this project we are importing the python libraries to analyze the dataset and visualizing the sales data
Below are the process performed with the dataset
* Analysing the data
* Cleaning the data
* Handling outlier
* Statistical summary
* Visualizing the dataset

# Processes Performed:
# Data Analysis:

Conduct an exploratory analysis to understand the dataset's structure, trends, and patterns.
# Data Cleaning:

Identify and rectify inconsistencies, missing values, and errors to ensure the dataset is reliable for analysis.
# Handling Outliers:

Use statistical methods to detect and manage outliers, ensuring they do not skew the analysis results.


# Statistical Summary:

Generate a summary of key statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to provide a concise overview of the data.
# Data Visualization:

Create informative visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to illustrate key findings and trends in the sales data, facilitating easier interpretation and decision-making.

This project demonstrates the application of data analysis techniques and visualization tools in Python, making it a valuable resource for understanding sales performance and trends.
